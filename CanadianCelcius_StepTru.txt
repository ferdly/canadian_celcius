1. Click 'Degree Wizard'
-> by menu item it calls 'drupal_get_form' with the parameter 'degree_wizard_fozrm' from dot-module

2. drupal_get_form('degree_wizard_fozrm') is called. This creates $form_state, assigns first parameter ('degree_wizard_fozrm') to $form_id and adds any additional arguments to $form_state['build_info']['args'] as array of remaining args. Which in turn calls drupal_build_form($form_id, $form_state).

3. drupal_build_form('degree_wizard_fozrm') is called.
3.a. += form_state_defaults()// UNION, meaning create if not exists from function return
3.b. assign the $form_state input from the 'method' super global (usually the entire  $_POST array, if not 'get')
